This repository contains an R-script to semi-automatically code answers to the question "*What do you think are the most important problems in our country, today?*" into one of several pre-defined categories. The script compares each answer against a set of fixed keywords and pre-coded answers from earlier waves using exact and fuzzy matching. If SPSS is one's primary tool and gets preference over R, there's a function to generate matching SPSS recode syntax.


### 1. Code answers
```R
[...]
```

### 2. Create SPSS syntax
Load functions `xlsx` and `xlsx_to_sps`:
```R
install.packages("xlsx")
library(xlsx)

xlsx_to_sps <- eval(parse(text = source("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/siardv/mip-spss-coder/main/xlsx_to_sps.R")[1]))
```
